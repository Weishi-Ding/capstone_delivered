**Code File Overview**:
This code file introduces the `Agent` class, which serves as a key component in the reinforcement learning project focused on Q-learning models. The `Agent` class encapsulates functionalities related to training, validation, and decision-making processes for an agent operating within a stock trading environment. It interacts with neural network models, experience buffers, and trading environments to facilitate the learning and decision-making capabilities of the agent.

**Function Documentation**:

1. `__init__(self, model=None)`: 
   - Initializes the `Agent` class with essential attributes such as the state, portfolio, input and output dimensions, action space, policy and target neural network models, and an experience buffer.
  
2. `get_action(self, state, epsilon)`: 
   - Determines the action to be taken by the agent based on the current state and an epsilon-greedy strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation.

3. `validation(self, val_env, device)`: 
   - Conducts validation of the agent's policy by interacting with a validation environment, calculating losses, and updating the experience buffer.

4. `train(self, train_env, val_env, num_episode, batch_size, epsilon, gamma, lr, device)`: 
   - Trains the agent by interacting with a training environment over multiple episodes, updating the policy network, calculating losses, and periodically updating the target network.

**Additional Insights**:
