**Code File Overview**:
This code file appears to focus on training an agent using reinforcement learning techniques on stock trading data. It includes sections for processing data, training the agent, conducting backtests, and building a portfolio based on the learned strategies. The file imports necessary libraries, sets up key parameters, processes the data, trains the agent, evaluates performance metrics, and constructs a portfolio using the trained model.

**Function Documentation**:

1. `process_data(data, test=False)`: This function processes the input data by dropping the first column, normalizing the data, and handling missing values. It returns the processed data.

2. `train_env = Environment(train_data)`: Initializes the training environment using the processed training data.

3. `val_env = Environment(val_data)`: Initializes the validation environment using the processed validation data.

4. `agent = Agent()`: Initializes the agent for training.

5. `agent.train(train_env, val_env, 50, batch_size, epsilon, gamma, lr, device)`: Trains the agent using the training and validation environments for 50 episodes with specified parameters.

6. `test_env = Environment(test_data)`: Initializes the testing environment using the processed test data.

7. `backtest = Backtest(0, agent, test_env)`: Initializes a backtest object with the agent and testing environment.

8. `backtest.execute()`: Executes the backtest using the trained agent.

9. `backtest.show_result()`: Displays the results of the backtest.

10. `Portfolio(stock_list)`: Initializes a portfolio object with a list of stocks.

11. `p.initialize()`: Initializes the portfolio.

12. `p.run()`: Runs the portfolio strategy.

13. `p.evaluate()`: Evaluates the portfolio performance.
