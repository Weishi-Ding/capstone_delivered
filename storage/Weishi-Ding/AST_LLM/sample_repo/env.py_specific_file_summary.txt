**Code File Overview**:
The current code file defines a class named `Environment` that encapsulates the environment for a reinforcement learning project focused on stock trading. This class includes methods for resetting the environment and taking a step based on the chosen action and portfolio status. The environment involves selecting a stock, managing time steps, and calculating rewards based on trading actions.

**Function Documentation**:

1. `__init__(self, df)`: The constructor method initializes the `Environment` class with the provided dataframe `df`, which contains stock trading data. It sets up attributes such as the stock list, current stock code, current stock dataframe, and time step.

2. `reset(self)`: This method resets the environment by selecting a new stock from the stock list, sorting the stock data by trade date, and resetting the time step. It returns the initial state for the selected stock.

3. `step(self, action, portfolio)`: The `step` method takes an action and the current portfolio status as input. It updates the time step, calculates the next state, reward, and new portfolio based on the action taken. It also checks for termination conditions and returns relevant information.

**Additional Insights**:
- The `Environment` class in this code file plays a crucial role in simulating the stock trading environment for the reinforcement learning agent. It handles the selection of stocks, progression through time steps, and reward calculation based on trading actions.
- The code includes commented-out sections related to factors like trend analysis, buying, selling, and holding actions, as well as reward calculations based on portfolio changes. These sections indicate potential future enhancements or alternative strategies that could be explored within the project.
- The reward calculation logic considers factors such as portfolio adjustments, stock price changes, and penalties/rewards for significant drawdowns or profits. This demonstrates a thoughtful approach to designing the reward system for training the reinforcement learning agent in stock trading scenarios.
