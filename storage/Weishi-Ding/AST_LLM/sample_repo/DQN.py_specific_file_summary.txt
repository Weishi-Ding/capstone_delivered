**Code File Overview**:
This code file defines a DQN (Deep Q-Network) class, an Experience named tuple, and an Experience_Buffer class. The DQN class represents a neural network model for Q-learning, while the Experience_Buffer class manages a buffer of experiences for training the DQN model.

**Function Documentation**:
1. `DQN` class:
   - `__init__(self, input_dim, output_dim)`: Initializes the DQN model with the specified input and output dimensions.
   - `forward(self, x)`: Defines the forward pass of the DQN model.

2. `Experience` named tuple:
   - Represents a single experience tuple containing state, action, reward, and next_state.

3. `Experience_Buffer` class:
   - `__init__(self, buffer_cap=1000)`: Initializes the experience buffer with a specified capacity.
   - `add(self, experience)`: Adds a new experience to the buffer, managing the buffer size.
   - `sample(self, batch_size)`: Randomly samples experiences from the buffer based on the specified batch size.
   - `can_provide_sample(self, batch_size)`: Checks if the buffer can provide a sample of the specified batch size.

**Additional Insights**:
- The DQN class defines a simple feedforward neural network with three linear layers and ReLU activation functions, suitable for Q-learning tasks.
- The Experience_Buffer class implements a replay buffer mechanism essential for experience replay in reinforcement learning, aiding in stabilizing and improving the training process of the DQN model.
- The code file focuses on core components necessary for implementing Q-learning algorithms, showcasing a structured approach to reinforcement learning model design and training.
