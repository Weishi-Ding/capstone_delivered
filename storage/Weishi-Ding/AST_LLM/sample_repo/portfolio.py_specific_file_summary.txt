**Function Documentation:**
- No new functions are defined in the current code chunk.

**Additional Insights:**
- The current code chunk imports necessary libraries and modules such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, torch, and collections.
- It also imports custom utility functions from `utils`, the `Agent` class from `agent`, the `Environment` class from `env`, and the `Backtest` class from `backtest`.
- The `Portfolio` class seems to be part of the same file, but its implementation is not included in this code chunk.
- The imported modules and classes suggest that the `Portfolio` class will interact with agents, environments, and backtests to manage the portfolio effectively.

This code chunk sets the stage by importing essential libraries, custom classes, and utility functions required for managing the portfolio. The presence of these imports indicates that the `Portfolio` class will leverage functionalities provided by these modules to carry out its operations effectively. Further examination of the `Portfolio` class implementation is needed to understand how these components interact within the portfolio management system.
