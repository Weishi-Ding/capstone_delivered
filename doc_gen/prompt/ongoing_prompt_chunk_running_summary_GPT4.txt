We are documenting a Python code repository, reviewing each file systematically. 

We have already prepared a running summary for already seen file from repo in a structured format of a README.md, given below:

```{summary}```

We will be looking at a description for the current code file, please try to append relevant information from the current code file description to the supplied running summary.
When appending information, please adhere to the requirement below:

**Summary**:
- Preserve exisitng content in this section.
- Update the summary to reflect new insights, maintaining a clear and objective overview of the project's purpose and scope. Consider how the new file fits into and enhances the overall project narrative.


**Technology Stack**:
- Preserve exisitng content in this section.
- Detail any new technologies introduced in the current file. Describe how these technologies integrate with and enhance the existing technology stack.


**Engineering Highlights**:
