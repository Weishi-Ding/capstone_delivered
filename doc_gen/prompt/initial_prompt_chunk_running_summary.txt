We are documenting a Python code repository, reviewing each file systematically. Now, we are looking at the first code file.

Below is the code summary for the first code file we are looking at:

``` {description} ```

Based on the analysis of the current code file, your task is now to compose the initial running summary. This running summary should contribute to a comprehensive and evolving overview of the code repository as the language model see more and more files.

As you integrate insights from the new code file, ensure that the updates adhere to the README format, maintaining a balanced and comprehensive documentation that evolves with each file:

**Summary**:
- Compose the summary to reflect insights you gained from looking at the code summary, maintaining a clear and objective overview of the project's purpose and scope.
- As you have yet to seen code summary for any other file, do not make assumptions on unseen content.

**Technology Stack**:
- Detail any new technologies introduced in the current file. Describe how these technologies integrate with and enhance the existing technology stack.

**Engineering Highlights**:
- Include significant engineering decisions or achievements identified in the current file analysis. Describe these in a factual manner, highlighting their importance to the project.

**Features**:
- List new features or functionalities discovered in the current file analysis. Describe these features objectively, emphasizing their unique aspects and benefits.

**Usage**:
- If the current file introduces usage of important code snippets, document them.
- Be specific when documenting usage, for example, "what code file use what code to achieve what functionality" is a good amount details.
