We are generating documentation for a Python code repository. We already have a comprehensive summary of the entire code repository. Here's the summary:

```{summary}```

**Documentation Objectives:**
- The documentation should maintain a confident and professional tone, ensuring all statements are clear, factual, and devoid of any unnecessary flattery or subjective comments. 
- The readme should be free of any interpretative or subjective or commentary comments.
- Certainty should be conveyed in the language used, avoiding tentative words like "maybe" to present definitive information.

### README.md Structure

1. **Project Title**
- Provide a straightforward, concise title that accurately reflects the essence of the code repository.
